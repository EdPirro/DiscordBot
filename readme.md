Discord Bot
===========

The project consists in a very simple Discord bot, made to learn Discord.js API, it is capable of creating polls and letting users vote on those polls... That's basically it.

Dependencies
------------

In order to run this project you'll need node.js installed, click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) for the official node.js installation guide.


Running
----------

1. Fist, in a terminal, run:
   ```shell
		> npm install
	```
2. Then you'll have two options:
   - Change the [config.json file](config.json) setting the desired prefix and the token to your bot (recommended). 
   - Smply run (next step) and you'll be prompted for the token (the token will only be used in the current sossion and won't be saved).
3. Now you'll just need to run the project:
	```shell
		> npm start
	```
4. And that's all, now you can jump into discord and use the bot freely. (if it's your first time start off by using "?help").
